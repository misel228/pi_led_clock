# Pi LED clock
A clock made out of two LED rings, powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W and an [RaspIO InspiRing](https://github.com/raspitv/raspio-inspiring).

The outer ring is from [LED Genial](https://www.led-genial.de/DIGI-DOT-Viertelring-mit-15-x-SK6812-Mini-LEDs-4-Stueck). I still have to figure out how to address this one.
